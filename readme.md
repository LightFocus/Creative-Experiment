Creative Experiment

Buliding a website that gives access to Google in mainland China.

## How it works

Deploy the code on an Apache Web Server that supports PHP, the code will grab anything that users ask directly from www.google.com and print out the raw HTML code. You must have your web server outside mainland China to access Google.

This is not proxy.

Sorry for the messy code since I did not spend too much time on it.
